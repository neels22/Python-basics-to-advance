# when using string list dictionary or other objects  we were able to call methods off of them with the .method_name() syntax

# these methods act as functions that we use information about the object as well as the object itself to return results or change the current object 

# example appending to list or counting  the occurences of an element in a tuple 

# oops allow users to create their own objects 
# the general format if often confusing when first encountered and its usefulness may not be completely clear at first

# in general oops allows us to create code that is repeatable and organized 

# commonly repeated tasks and objects can be defined with oop to create code that is more usable
